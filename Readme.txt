# Module 1 Challenge

# Challenge is made for scraping a website on news about mars and a table on mars temperature/pressure data
# The table was used to create plots about temperature, pressure and year lengths on Mars

# Used Professor Booth's office hour recordings to guide on scraping
# Had to use ChatGPT for issue with bar plot missing the label for first x-axis tick for the months

# Thanks for reading!! :))
